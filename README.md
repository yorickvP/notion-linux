# Notion for Linux

Native Notion packages for Linux, built from Notion's Windows installer.

## Install

Run the following commands in a terminal to install Notion. Packages are available for Intel/AMD and ARM64.

To install Notion with [Notion Enhancer](https://github.com/notion-enhancer/notion-enhancer) mods applied, replace `notion-desktop` with `notion-enhanced` in the commands below.

### Ubuntu, Debian, Linux Mint

```sh
wget https://notion.davidbailey.codes/notion-linux.list
sudo mv notion-linux.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/notion-linux.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install notion-desktop
```

### Fedora, CentOS

```sh
wget https://notion.davidbailey.codes/notion-linux.repo
sudo mv notion-linux.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/notion-linux.repo
sudo dnf install notion-desktop
```

### openSUSE

```sh
sudo zypper ar -r https://notion.davidbailey.codes/notion-linux.repo
sudo zypper --gpg-auto-import-keys install notion-desktop
```

## Build

### Nix
```sh
./scripts/build-nix.sh
```

### Install requirements

1. Install Node.js, e.g. using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm):

   ```sh
   nvm install node
   ```

2. Install NPM version 7:

   ```sh
   npm install -g npm@7
   ```

3. Install other packages required for building the app, e.g. using `apt`:

   ```sh
   sudo apt install p7zip-full imagemagick make g++ fakeroot rpm
   ```

   Only Debian-based distributions are officially supported for builds.

### Build `notion-desktop`

`notion-desktop` is the vanilla Notion package.

To produce an AMD64 build, run the following:

```sh
scripts/build.sh        # always run
scripts/package-deb.sh  # run to produce a DEB
scripts/package-rpm.sh  # run to produce an RPM
```

To produce an ARM64 build, run the following:

```sh
scripts/build.sh -b arm64        # always run
scripts/package-deb.sh -b arm64  # run to produce a DEB
scripts/package-rpm.sh -b arm64  # run to produce an RPM
```

Once complete, you should have DEB and/or RPM packages in the `out` directory.

### Build `notion-enhanced`

`notion-enhanced` is the Notion package with [Notion Enhancer](https://github.com/notion-enhancer/notion-enhancer) mods applied.

To produce an AMD64 build, run the following:

```sh
scripts/build.sh                           # always run
scripts/enhance.sh                         # always run
scripts/package-deb.sh -n notion-enhanced  # run to produce a DEB
scripts/package-rpm.sh -n notion-enhanced  # run to produce an RPM
```

To produce an ARM64 build, run the following:

```sh
scripts/build.sh -b arm64                           # always run
scripts/enhance.sh -b arm64                         # always run
scripts/package-deb.sh -n notion-enhanced -b arm64  # run to produce a DEB
scripts/package-rpm.sh -n notion-enhanced -b arm64  # run to produce an RPM
```

Once complete, you should have DEB and/or RPM packages in the `out` directory.
